# Snippets from common log messages. These are used to determine when entries
# with dynamic content (hostnames, numbers, etc) are the same. If this matches
# the start of both messages then the entries are flagged as duplicates. If the
# entry begins with an asterisk (*) then it checks if the substrings exist
# anywhere in the messages.

# Examples for the complete messages:

# [DEBUG] conn_read_callback(): socket 7 wants to read.
# [DEBUG] conn_write_callback(): socket 51 wants to write.
# [DEBUG] connection_remove(): removing socket -1 (type OR), n_conns now 50
# [DEBUG] connection_or_process_cells_from_inbuf(): 7: starting, inbuf_datalen
#         0 (0 pending in tls object).

# [NOTICE] Circuit build timeout of 96803ms is beyond the maximum build time we

#   The above NOTICE changes to an INFO message in maint-0.2.2
# [NOTICE] Based on 1000 circuit times, it looks like we don't need to wait so 
#          long for circuits to finish. We will now assume a circuit is too slow
#          to use after waiting 65 seconds.
# [NOTICE] We stalled too much while trying to write 150 bytes to address
#          [scrubbed].  If this happens a lot, either something is wrong with

# [NOTICE] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a
#          circuit: We have only 469/2027 usable descriptors.
# [NOTICE] Attempt by %s to open a stream from unknown relay. Closing.
# [NOTICE] Average packaged cell fullness: 70.976%. TLS write overhead: 11%
# [NOTICE] Heartbeat: Tor's uptime is 8 days 6:00 hours, with 0 circuits open.
#          I've sent 3.53 MB and received 90.61 MB.
